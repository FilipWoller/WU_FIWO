  <h1>Nvidia GTX 1070 Ti release date, specs, and performance </h1>
  <p>Nvidia have finally launched their GTX 1070 Ti graphics card. Jen-Hsun has already said that “Pascal is unbeatable” and that it would be around for the holiday season and the foreseeable future, so it isn’t that surprising to see the green team releasing another current-gen GPU - yet hopefully their last Pascal-based GPU before Volta.

Quite why Nvidia are doing this, however, is more interesting. Given the perceived failings of AMD’s recent Vega GPUs, it seems they have little genuine competition at the high end of the graphics market, so they could just leave the GTX 1080 and GTX 1070 to battle the Vega cards.  But there is the slightest chance future games could take better advantage of the Vega GPUs, with recent game releases offering team Radeon a little hope.

The idea that the GTX 1070 Ti is being designed as a contract killer with the RX Vega 56 in its sights is a tempting one, but I would be surprised if Nvidia really felt the need to release a new card just for this purpose.</p>

  <h1> Big Bets on A.I. Open a New Frontier for Chip Start-Ups, Too </h1>
<p>SAN FRANCISCO — For years, tech industry financiers showed little interest in start-up companies that made computer chips.

How on earth could a start-up compete with a goliath like Intel, which made the chips that ran more than 80 percent of the world’s personal computers? Even in the areas where Intel didn’t dominate, like smartphones and gaming devices, there were companies like Qualcomm and Nvidia that could squash an upstart.</p>
